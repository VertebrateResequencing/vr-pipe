# perl Build.PL
# Then before each commit, run the test for the module you altered:
# ./Build test --verbose --test_files t/appropriatetestscript.t
# And if you did something major, run the whole test suite:
# ./Build test
#
# less often, when interested:
# ./Build testcover
# ./Build testpod
# ./Build testpodcoverage
#
# setenv DEVEL_COVER_OPTIONS '+ignore,5.8.8'
