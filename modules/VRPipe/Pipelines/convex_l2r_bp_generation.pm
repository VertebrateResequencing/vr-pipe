VRPipe::Pipelines::convex_l2r_bp_generation - a pipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is second of of three pipeline required to run in sequence in order to
generate CNV Calls using the Convex Exome CNV detection package. This pipeline
generates L2R files, and a single Breakpoints file, from the Read Depth files
generated by the previous pipeline convex_read_depth_generation. The Convex L2R
program runs once only for a set of Read Depth files, so its datasource will be
a vrpipe group_by_metadata set of Read Depth files from the previous pipeline.
