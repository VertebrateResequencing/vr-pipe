VRPipe::Pipelines::convex_read_depth_generation - a pipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is first of three pipeline required to run in sequence in order to
generate CNV Calls using the Convex Exome CNV detection package. This pipeline
generates Read Depth files from a BAM Datasource, and adds Sample and Sex
metadata to the bams, for subsequent L2R Generation and CNV Calling pipelines.
