VRPipe::Pipelines::convex_cnv_calling - a pipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is third of three pipeline required to run in sequence in order to
generate CNV Calls using the Convex Exome CNV detection package. This pipeline
generates CNV calls from the Read Depth and L2R files, generated by the
previous pipelines convex_read_depth_generation and convex_l2r_bp_generation.
Its datasource will probably a vrpipe datasource from the convex_read_depth
Step of the convex_read_depth_generation pipeline.
