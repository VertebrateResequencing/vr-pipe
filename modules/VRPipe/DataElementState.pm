=head1 NAME

VRPipe::DataElementState - tracks the state of a DataElement for a given Setup

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<VRPipe::DataElement> can be the input to multiple different
L<VRPipe::PipelineSetup>s; this object keeps track of how many steps in the
pipeline a DataElement has gotten through in a particular PipelineSetup.
