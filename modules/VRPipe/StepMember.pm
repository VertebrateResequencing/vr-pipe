VRPipe::StepMember - a Step of a Pipeline

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<VRPipe::Step> can be reused in multiple different L<VRPipe::Pipeline>s. A
Pipeline itself does not hold a list of Steps within its definition. Instead it
C<has_many> StepMembers, which tie a Step to a particular Pipeline and also
notes the C<step_number()>, so that the correct order of Steps is known.
