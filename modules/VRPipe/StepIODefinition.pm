VRPipe::StepIODefinition - define inputs and outputs of a Step

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<VRPipe> must know what a L<VRPipe::Step> requires as input, and what it
outputs. With this knowledge it can ensure that a B<VRPipe::Pipeline> makes
sense and that it is functioning correctly whilst running (it automatically
checks that input and output files exist before proceeding along the Pipeline).

A StepIODefinition can be used when writing a C<VRPipe::Steps::[step_name]>
module to define what is expected of input and output files without having to
know their paths (Steps should never care about file locations or names; they
are unknowable at the time of writing a Step anyway).
