VRPipe::Parser::bamcheck - parse bamcheck files

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    use VRPipe::Parser;
    
    # create object, supplying bas file
    my $pars = VRPipe::Parser->create('bamcheck', {file => 'my.bam.bamcheck'});
    
    # unlike normal parsers, you do not use parsed_record() or next_record();
    # instead access information in the bamcheck file through the following
    # methods
    
    # methods that return simple single values corresponding to the SN lines in
    # the bamcheck file:
    my $val = $pars->raw_total_sequences();
    $val = $pars->sequences(); # number of sequences after any -f/F filtering
    $val = $pars->is_paired();
    $val = $pars->is_sorted();
    $val = $pars->first_fragments();
    $val = $pars->last_fragments();
    $val = $pars->reads_mapped();
    $val = $pars->reads_unmapped();
    $val = $pars->reads_unpaired();
    $val = $pars->reads_paired();
    $val = $pars->reads_duplicated();
    $val = $pars->reads_mq0();
    $val = $pars->total_length();
    $val = $pars->bases_mapped();
    $val = $pars->bases_mapped_cigar();
    $val = $pars->bases_trimmed();
    $val = $pars->bases_duplicated();

    $val = $pars->outward_oriented_pairs();
    $val = $pars->pairs_with_other_orientation();
    $val = $pars->reads_properly_paired();
    $val = $pars->reads_mapped_and_paired();
    
    # COV lines give the coverage:
    my $cov_hash = $pars->coverage(); # keys are coverage in bp, vals are counts
    my $cum_hash = $pars->cumulative_coverage; # as above, but cumulative counts
    my $mean = $pars->mean_coverage(); # a number
    
    # The remaining sections of the file can be accessed by calling one of the
    # following methods, which all return an array ref. Each element of this ref
    # corresponds to a line from that section, and the element is an array ref
    # of all the values on the line, excluding the first column.
    my $array_ref = $pars->first_fragment_qualities(); # FFQ lines
    my $array_ref = $pars->last_fragment_qualities(); # LFQ lines

    my $array_ref = $pars->last_fragment_gc(); # GCL lines
    my $array_ref = $pars->indel_cycles(); # IC lines
    my $array_ref = $pars->indel_dist(); # ID lines
    my $array_ref = $pars->insert_size(); # IS lines
    my $array_ref = $pars->gc_depth(); # GCD lines

 Title   : parsed_record
 Usage   : my $parsed_record= $obj->parsed_record()
 Function: Get the data structure that will hold the last parsed record
           requested by next_record()
 Returns : array ref, currently empty, since only SN lines are parsed so far,
           and their content can be found with other methods
 Args    : n/a

 Usage   : while ($obj->next_record()) { # look in parsed_record }
 Function: next_record does nothing in this parser; use the various methods to

 Returns : 0
