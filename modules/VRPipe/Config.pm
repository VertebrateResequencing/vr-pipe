VRPipe::Config - read/writer for site-wide config details

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    use VRPipe::Config;
    
    my $vrp_config = VRPipe::Config->new();
    
    my $production_dbtype = $vrp_config->production_dbtype;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines the site-wide configuration options that many VRPipe
classes need to function and blindly expect to be defined. This module is
supposed to be used, and all the necessary options defined by the user, during
the initial build process. See Build.PL.

It is implemented using L<VRPipe::Base::Configuration>; see that module for
more details beyond simply getting config option values as shown in the
synopsis.
