=head1 NAME

VRPipe::Requirements - describes what system resources are needed to run a Job

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order to execute a command line on a compute cluster, some job scheduling
system (like LSF) will be in place to select the node on which to run the job,
and to choose which job gets run first. For optimal efficiency the scheduler
should be told the likely amount of memory, time and other system resources the
job will need.

This Requirements class holds these scheduling hints. A L<VRPipe::Submission>
then ties a Requirements to a L<VRPipe::Job>.
