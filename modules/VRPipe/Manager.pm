VRPipe::Manager - methods for managing the execution of pipelines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the main module used to discover what work needs to be done ('trigger'
each L<VRPipe::PipelineSetup>) and then to 'dispatch' that work out to the
system's job scheduler to actually run the command lines on the compute
cluster.

The B<vrpipe-trigger_pipelines> and B<vrpipe-dispatch_pipelines> scripts call
methods of this module.

Note that the current implementation is slow and inefficient, with lots of
serial looping over thousands of objects. A radical overhaul is planned.
