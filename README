[You should read IMPORTANT_NOTES which notes version-specific issues]


VRPipe is a generic pipeline system designed for use by the Vertebrate
Resequencing team at the Sanger Institute, but also for broad use for anyone.

For an overview of why it was created, read our vision document:
https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/vr-pipe/wiki/Vision

It comprises mostly self-documented Perl code. There are both scripts and 
modules within subfolders.

Help on each module is currently of limited availability, but eventually all
will be self-documented with POD, which can be read with eg. perldoc.

Each script has a --help option, eg:
vrpipe-status --help



INSTALLATION
------------

You will need the source version of samtools compiled with -fPIC and -m64 in the
CFLAGS, and the environment variable SAMTOOLS pointing to that source directory
(which should now contain bam.h and libbam.a, and MUST contain the samtools
executable). Samtools can be downloaded from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/
(Note that tests use the samtools in your PATH, not the samtools in your
SAMTOOLS dir; production pipelines will use the samtools at the absolute path
you configure them with during setup - the default will be the first one in your
PATH.)

You need Redis 2.6.5 or greater installed. Compile it as normal ('make') and
simply include redis-server in your PATH. You do not have to configure it in any
way. Redis can be downloaded from here: http://redis.io/download

It is also recommended that you set PERL_INLINE_DIRECTORY to ~/.Inline and
create that directory.

You require Module::Build in order for the Build.PL script to work. It is
recommended you 'install Bundle::CPAN' using 'cpan' prior to attempting setup.


First, do the initial setup and dependency installation:
$ perl Build.PL

If this says you have "ERRORS/WARNINGS FOUND IN PREREQUISITES" try:
$ ./Build installdeps
to install missing prerequisites from CPAN.

installdeps will install things automatically in some random order, but ideally
you should manually install certain modules in a specific order:
1) EV
2) AnyEvent
3) Continuity (specifically its Coro dependency)

Possible problems you may encounter in installing your missing prerequisites:
# You may find that you have to unset your LANG environment variable temporarily
  to install all CPAN prerequisites.
# You will likely find that Inline::Filters fails its preprocess.t test; this is
  ok and you can manually use 'cpan' to:
  cpan> force install Inline::Filters
# You may find that MooseX::Types::Parameterizable fails its tests. In that case
  you can manually use 'cpan' to install an earlier version that should work:
  cpan> install JJNAPIORK/MooseX-Types-Parameterizable-0.07.tar.gz
# If you find that AnyEvent::ForkManager fails tests and emits errors
  mentioning WNOHANG, you will have to cd to the cpan build directory and edit
  line 11 of blib/lib/AnyEvent/ForkManager.pm to read "use POSIX qw(WNOHANG);"
  (without the quotes). Then you can do "make test" and "make install".
# Twiggy may fail its disconnect.t test. This is safe to ignore; just:
  cpan> force install Twiggy
# You may encounter difficulties installing Proc::ProcessTable, which is one of
  Proc::Killfam's dependencies. In that case, try manually installing an earlier
  version of it before retrying the Proc::Killfam install normally:
  cpan> install DURIST/Proc-ProcessTable-0.44.tar.gz
# Some installs of Perl 5.8.8 can have trouble with Class::Accessor::Grouped (a
  prerequisite of DBIx::Class), where some tests fail due to desired error
  messages not looking quite right. This should be harmless in reality, so just
  force install it:
  cpan> force install Class::Accessor::Grouped
  and then try the DBIx::Class installation again normally.
# If you run into a problem installing XML::LibXML due to an inability to find
  the required libs, try using your OS package management system to install it,
  eg. for Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
# Likewise for XML::LibXSLT:
  sudo apt-get install libxml-libxslt-perl
# Crypt::Random has a prerequisite of Math::Pari, which in turn requires pari-gp
  and may have trouble finding and using it. If you encounter problems, try
  entering the cpan build directory where it tried to build Math::Pari, then
  do:
  sudo wget ftp://megrez.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/unix/OLD/pari-2.3.5.tar.gz
  sudo perl Makefile.PL Configure pari_tgz=./pari-2.3.5.tgz
  sudo make; sudo make test; sudo make install
# If all the prerequisites seem to be installed but running 'perl Build.PL'
  gives you an error message mentioning problems with any kind of Moose module,
  one possibility is that you have a mixture of some new Moose modules and old
  ones. You can solve this by updating all your Moose-related modules to their
  latest versions. Eg. if you have cpanm installed, try:
  $ cpanm Class::MOP Fey Fey::ORM MooseX::Aliases MooseX::ClassAttribute
    MooseX::LazyRequire MooseX::Method::Signatures MooseX::NonMoose MooseX::POE
    MooseX::Role::Cmd MooseX::Role::Parameterized MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor
    MooseX::Singleton MooseX::StrictConstructor
# If you get as far as running "./Build test" (see below), and find some tests
  failing with an error message that mentions IO::Uncompress::Gunzip, try
  installing the latest version of that:
  cpan> install IO::Uncompress::Gunzip

Once the prerequisites are installed you will be asked a number of setup
questions such as the details of your production and testing databases. It is
recommended to use a stand-alone relational database such as MySQL. The pipeline
functionality requires such a database, but if you're only using code such as a
parser or the bas function you can use SQLite, supplying a file path for the
database name. Note that the local scheduler currently doesn't work well with an
SQLite database, so some tests are likely to fail with that combination.

Note that when using MySQL, the server should be configured to allow at least
1/3 as many connections as you have CPUs in your cluster. It must also allow
the transaction isolation level to be changed. In practice this means that if
you have database replication set up, you may find that you have to reconfigure
the server to binlog-mode=MIXED and restart/redo your replication server.

Once setup is complete modules/VRPipe/SiteConfig.pm will have been created. It
is this file that holds your site-wide configuration of VRPipe.


To test the code prior to using it:
$ ./Build test

A number of environment variables affect which tests run and how. In most cases
it is fine to not worry about these extra variables. They are described here for
the sake of completeness.
VRPIPE_TEST_PIPELINES, when true, will fully test all the pipelines and steps
                       instead of just the core functionality of the system.
                       These tests take a very long time - potentially hours -
                       so this is off by default. If you're interested in
                       running a particular pipeline, you can test just that
                       pipeline by setting this variable to true and then
                       running:
               $ ./Build test --test_files t/VRPipe/Pipelines/[name].t --verbose
GATK, pointing to a directory containing GATK jar files, will enable tests that
      require GATK
GATK2, pointing to a directory containing GATK version 2+ jar files, will enable
      tests that require GATK version 2 or higher
PICARD, pointing to a directory containing Picard jar files, will enable tests
      that require Picard
CRAMTOOLS, pointing to a directory containing Cramtools jar files, will enable
      tests that require Cramtools
TRIMMOMATIC_JAR_PATH, pointing to the timmomatic .jar file, will enable tests
      that require Trimmomatic
CONVEX_R_LIB, pointing to a directory containing your R lib files, will enable
      tests of Convex
VRPIPE_VRTRACK_TESTDB will enable testing of the VRTrack DataSource, using the
                      value supplied as the database name (other database
                      details will come from the standard VRTrack environment
                      variables)
Additionally, tests that require certain executables will not run unless you
have those executables in your PATH.


To install:
$ ./Build install
(or just include the modules subdirectory in your PERL5LIB, and include the
scripts subdirectory in your PATH)

To create your production database (testing database is created automatically):
$ vrpipe-db_deploy

If in the future the VRPipe code is updated and there is a change to the schema,
you will need to stop VRPipe, update your code, then run:
$ vrpipe-db_upgrade


To use:
Ensure that vrpipe-server is always running on a machine that can submit jobs
to your job scheduler:
$ vrpipe-server --farm my_farm start
Now you can use vrpipe-create_step and vrpipe-create_pipeline to create
pipelines if necessary. Then end-users can set up a pipeline using vrpipe-setup.
vrpipe-setup and vrpipe-status will be the most commonly used scripts. Access to
output files can be achieved with vrpipe-output.

As a general point, any Perl script you write that wants to use some VRPipe
code should typically "use VRPipe;". After that most things should work without
further "use" statements. To choose the deployment you can "import" the one you
want. eg. to work with your testing database:
    use VRPipe 'testing';
or on the command-line:
$ perl -MVRPipe=testing -e '...'



EXTERNAL SOFTWARE
-----------------

Some software need environment variables setup (using setenv in csh or export in
bash). The following list shows the name of the software, the environment
variable you need to set, and the value you should set it to, separated by
commas.

samtools,SAMTOOLS,/path/to/samtools/source_directory
cramtools,CRAMTOOLS,/path/to/cramtools_jar_files

eg. to have cramtools work properly in the pipelines you might do:
setenv CRAMTOOLS /path/to/cramtools_jar_files
or
export CRAMTOOLS=/path/to/cramtools_jar_files
depending on what shell you are using.

These values are used internally and are independent of values you might set
when asked for eg. the path to your cramtools jars when running vrpipe-setup.

A number of other environment variables are used to setup default values for
when running vrpipe-setup, but are not required to use the software (ie. you can
just manually enter the required path each time you setup the pipeline):

GATK,GATK,/path/to/GATK_jar_files
GATK2,GATK2,/path/to/GATK2_jar_files
picard,PICARD,/path/to/picard_jar_files
R,R_LIB,/path/to/R_library_files
bismark,BISMARK_GENOME_FOLDER,/path/to/bismark_genome_files
trimmomatic,TRIMMOMATIC_JAR_PATH,/path/to/trimmomatic_jar_file
